 Image fraud detection typically involves using machine learning techniques to identify forged or manipulated images. One common approach is to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.
 using the popular deep learning library TensorFlow and its high-level API, Keras


# Image Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates a simple image fraud detection system using machine learning. The code uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with TensorFlow and Keras to classify images as genuine or manipulated.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (`pip install tensorflow`)
- scikit-learn (`pip install scikit-learn`)
- Pillow (`pip install pillow`)

## Dataset

The dataset is assumed to be organized into two folders:
- `genuine_images_path`: Contains genuine (non-manipulated) images.
- `manipulated_images_path`: Contains manipulated images.

Ensure that the images are in either JPG or PNG format.
